# Sprint Recipe

Example: Basic MkDocs project for Read the Docs
===============================================

Example Project usage
---------------------
    - we dont review every single story and estimate it
    - we focus on the value each stream wants to deliver
    - we use the team hive mind to discuss and estimate when its needed
    - we use at least 2 points of ops buffer per sprint for expected random incoming ops/sre work
    day by day plan:
    monday - SDM - clean up old epics and stories
    monday - SDM - create sprint after next
    monday - SDM - create the preplanning doc [copy the old preplanning doc] 
    tuesday - SDM - clean up old epics and stories
    tuesday - SDM - identify carry over work from prior preplannig doc as you can
    tuesday - SDM - figures out capacity and updates sprint capacity sheet
    wednesday - all - team async review
    wednesday - SDM - create the next 2 sprints
    tuesday - SDM - async review with SDMs and PMs
    wednesday - all - create the epics and stories that belong in next sprint [add estimates and assignees as you see fit]  
    tuesday - SDM - make sure to keep the wow detailed plan in mind [eg MD alerts work for MK]
    thursday - punt work 
    thursday - double check your capacity for next sprint 
    thursday - ensure we have a Scrum Leader and a Poker Room Leader
    friday - punt work

Example Project usage
---------------------
- check to make sure we need this meeting first
- pull up next sprint
- sort by story title
- stream owner describes sprint goal(s)
- stream owner identifies what stories (if any) need team input 
- estimates via poker room 
- update SIM
- filter SIM by SDE and check allocation and update capacity sheet
- filter SIM by nobody and check to make sure theres nothing we missed
- punt nobody stories to next sprint
- stream owners send out 15 5 reports by EOD to amg-status-reports@amazon.com
- close out the **old** sprint
- export metrics from **old** sprint and send out agile metrics report to amg-status-reports@amazon.com
